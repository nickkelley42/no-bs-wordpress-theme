# No BS Wordpress Theme

Inspired by [motherfuckingwebsite.com](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com).

The goal of this project is to create as minimal a Wordpress theme as
possible, giving us the saucy CMS goodness of Wordpress combined with a
lightweight, accessible, and barebones frontend.

This theme will become highly customizable, but will generally assume
that you want minimal bullshit and want the focus to be on your CONTENT,
not your flashy webpage.

The theme is currently incomplete; features still to be added include:

* Top and footer menus
* Search box (this feature might be nixed in favor of users adding it to
  their menus)
* Links between pages/categories/etc
* Category/tag display on posts
